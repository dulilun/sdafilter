Description: We develop a new class of distribution free multiple testing rules for false discovery rate (FDR) control under general dependence. 
    A key element in our proposal is a symmetrized data aggregation (SDA) approach to incorporating the dependence structure via sample splitting, 
    data screening and information pooling. The proposed SDA filter first constructs a sequence of ranking statistics 
    that fulfill global symmetry properties, and then chooses a data driven threshold along the ranking to control the FDR. 
    For more information, see the website below and the accompanying paper: Du et al. (2020), "False Discovery Rate 
    Control Under General Dependence By Symmetrized Data Aggregation", <arXiv:2002.11992>.
